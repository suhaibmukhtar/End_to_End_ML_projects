The setup is resposible for adding meta-data to the project like author, email of author, verison of package etc. It also consists the find_packages() parameter which will find how many packages were imported during the execution of the project. This find_packages automatically finds the number and packages itself with help of "__init__.py" file inside the folder. Having this file inside the folder means that folder will be build as a package</p>
